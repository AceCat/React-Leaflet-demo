# React Webmap Demo

A bare bones vanilla [Leaflet.JS](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html) map created using React, Gulp, and Browserify.

Read the comments in `gulpfile.js` and `src/js/` to see what is going on.

## Install:

Make sure you have Node.JS installed and Gulp installed globally. Then do:  
`npm install`
